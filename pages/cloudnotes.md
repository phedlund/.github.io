CloudNotes is a notes app for iOS (iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad) and Mac OS X. CloudNotes syncs with the <a title="NextCloud Notes" href="https://github.com/nextcloud/notes/releases">Notes app</a> of your <a href="https://nextcloud.com">NextCloud</a> orÂ <a href="http://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a> server (server access is required).

Notes can be added and edited and they will be automatically saved and synced.

**Preparing the NextCloud/ownCloud server**

- Download the server Notes app directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/nextcloud/notes/releases "NextCloud Notes"). Other locations may have obsolete versions.
- Place the zip file in (next)(own)cloud/apps on the server and unzip it.
- Log in to the server and go to the Apps tab.
- Enable Notes.
- Verify that you can create and edit notes using the web interface.
- It should now be possible to log in from the CloudNotes app on your device.
