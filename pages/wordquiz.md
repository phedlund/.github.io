WordQuiz for iOS is a universal app that brings the power of WordQuiz to the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. You can bring your vocabularies with you and practice anytime. You can also create new vocabularies and edit existing ones.

WordQuiz for iOS features five quiz modes. You can run all the different quizzes from WordQuiz; Flashcard, Multiple Choice and Answer & Question.

WordQuiz for iOS supports vocabularies created in WordQuiz and KWordQuiz (.kvtml format). If you have lists from another source you can save them as character separated values (.csv format). Use the TAB character to separate front and back on each line.

The features of WordQuiz for iOS are described in more detail in a video and through a series of screenshots on the Screenshots page.
