CloudNews is a feed (RSS and Atom) reader for iOS (iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad). CloudNews syncs with the <a title="NextCloud News" href="https://github.com/nextcloud/news">News app</a> of your <a href="https://nextcloud.com">NextCloud</a> or <a href="http://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a> server (server access is required).
          
- Feeds can be added by entering their address (url) and will be synced.
- CloudNews uses swipe and pull gestures for most features making the interface clean and easy to understand.
- You can choose to read just the summary of an article or the original web version.
- Articles can be shared using several services. They can also be added to a Instapaper or Pocket account for later reading.
