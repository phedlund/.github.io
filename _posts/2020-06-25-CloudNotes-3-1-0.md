This update brings the ability to manually edit the title of a note if you are using newer versions of Nextcloud Notes.

On iOS 13 or later a new context menu is shown when long pressing on a note in the list.

The app is now also smarter in detecting if it is connecting to an ownCloud or a Nextcloud server.
